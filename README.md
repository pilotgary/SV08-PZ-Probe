# SV08-PZ-Probe
E3D Revo PZ-Probe for the Sovol SV08

## Project Aims
1. To swap the supplied hot end and Z probe for the E3D Revo PZ-Probe.
2. To use as many of the existing parts as possible.
3. To work with the Sovol branch of Klipper.
4. 3D printed parts should not require support.

## N ew 3D printed parts 
The new 3d printed parts can be found in the STEP directory.  As most modern slicers can open STEP files directly this is the preferred format for this project.

The parts should be orientated correctly on import as shown below. All parts have been designed so that support is not required, provided your printer can cope with small bridges.
